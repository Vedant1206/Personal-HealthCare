# Branching Strategy

<<<<<<< HEAD
GitHub Flow is our branching strategy. We create branches directly from the main branch on the remote, and then clone/pull that on individual local machines. We keep making commits on the branch - occassionally pulling and merging the main branch's updates when necessary - and when we are done working we merge our branches back into main. It differs from Git Flow in that it does not have a development branch. We chose GitHub Flow because it is simple. We decided that we do not need a development branch because we will review each other’s code thoroughly before merging it into the main branch.
