# Personal Healthcare

## Vision statement

### Summary sentences

The Personal Healthcare App will provide users with convenient diagnoses about the probable causes of their symptoms. Depending on the users’ medical reports and location, it will suggest a list of suitable doctors. The application will also provide doctors with a platform where they will be able to communicate with the users directly through the application to give their diagnoses and set up appointments. In detail, the users will be able to talk to doctors on the suggested list to request further information as well as make an appointment with doctors directly through the application. 

### Description

Users will be able to create an account and input their personal details such as their age, gender, and weight. Users will also be able to add multiple profiles for family members and easily switch between the profiles so that they can get accurate results based on their own personal details. 
They will be able to easily select which of their body parts are affected and what symptoms they are experiencing. The app will then provide a list of conditions that may be causing their symptoms. Alongside this, the app will provide a list of doctors in the user’s area that they may contact.  
Doctors will create their own accounts for contacting potential patients and their contact information will be displayed. The app will create a short user report to help the doctor understand the situation more thoroughly. 
After they have received their results, users will be presented with an option to select whether the results were helpful. The data from this quick survey will help us improve the app and the results it delivers.  

### Target audience

The users of this app will be mildly afflicted individuals who need only a cursory explanation of the cause of their symptoms. Any seriously afflicted individuals should not use this app and should instead seek medical attention immediately. This app only provides a list of conditions that may be causing a user’s symptoms, and this information should not be construed as medical advice. Users should always consult a doctor before they engage in any sort of treatment of their symptoms.  
Doctors who want to advertise their medical center may also be using this app because users may contact them through the app after receiving their results to set up appointments. 

### Value of app

This app will allow its users to get probable causes of their symptoms from reputed sources without needing to time looking up unreliable online sources. This app will hand users suggested conditions based on entered symptoms as well as users’ medically relevant account details (like age, weight, and medical conditions). The app will also show a list of doctors nearby in case the user feels the need to consult. 

### Success Criteria

This app will be considered a success if it achieves at least a four-star rating on the app store, has at least one hundred doctors signed up with an account, and at least seventy percent of users report that the results were helpful. 

# Branching Strategy

GitHub Flow is our branching strategy. We create branches directly from the main branch and when we are done working we merge our branches back into the main branch. It differs from Git Flow in that it does not have a development branch. We chose GitHub Flow because it is simple. We decided that we do not need a development branch because we will review each other’s code thoroughly before merging it into the main branch.
