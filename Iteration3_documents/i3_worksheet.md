What technical debt has been cleaned up
========================================

Show links to a commit where you paid off technical debt. Write 2-5 sentences
that explain what debt was paid, and what its classification is.

We had a log-in button in Iteration 2 that was not working properly. In this iteration, we implemented the features and adding new features around it. 
Now the login button is working fine and well.

What technical debt did you leave?
==================================


Right now, we left the small action of adding new profile in the profile list. 
We allow each user have one profile for now. In the future, we can extend it so that users can add new profiles.


Discuss a Feature or User Story that was cut/re-prioritized
============================================

Link: https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a01/group-1/personal_healthcare/-/issues/8

We decided to cut the feature at the begining of Iteration 3 as we expect this feature would take too much time and resources for us to complete in one iteraiton.
Instead, we want to focus on other features for Iteration 3.

Acceptance test/end-to-end
==========================

Write a discussion about an end-to-end test that you wrote. What did you test,
how did you set up the test so it was not flaky? Provide a link to that test.

Acceptance test, untestable
===============

What challenges did you face when creating acceptance tests? What was difficult
or impossible to test?

Velocity/teamwork
=================

We know about estimating better now than we did in the beginning. Since we know how fast we can work and how much work a task would actually take.
So for the features of editing profiles, we could assume it takes about 4 hours to make and we took like 5 hours. Though, it is more than what we expected, our estimation was pretty close.
