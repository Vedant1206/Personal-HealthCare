What technical debt has been cleaned up
========================================

Show links to a commit where you paid off technical debt. Write 2-5 sentences
that explain what debt was paid, and what its classification is.

We have a log in button in the iteration 2 that's not working well. In this iteration, we implemented the features and adding new features around it. 
Now the login button is working fine and well.

What technical debt did you leave?
==================================


Right now, we leave a small action of adding new profile in the profile list. 
We allow each user have one profile for now. In the feature, we can extend it that users can add new profiles.


Discuss a Feature or User Story that was cut/re-prioritized
============================================

Link: https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/winter-2022-a01/group-1/personal_healthcare/-/issues/8

We decided to cut the feature at hhe begining of the iteration 3 as we expect this feature would take too much time and resource than what we can do in 1 iteraiton.
Instead, we want to focus on other features for the iteration 3.

Acceptance test/end-to-end
==========================

Write a discussion about an end-to-end test that you wrote. What did you test,
how did you set up the test so it was not flaky? Provide a link to that test.

Acceptance test, untestable
===============

What challenges did you face when creating acceptance tests? What was difficult
or impossible to test?

Velocity/teamwork
=================

We know about estimating better than beginning now. Since we know how fast we can do and how much a task would take actually. 
So for the features of editing profiles, we could assume it takes about 4 hours to make and we took like 5 hours. Though, it is more than what we expected, our estimation was pretty close.
