# Retrospective Activity (~ 500 words)

## What part of our project has not been as successful as we would have liked?

We have not completed as many features as we would have liked.

## How can it be improved in this iteration (Iteration 3)?

We can increase the amount of time we spend working on features

## What are some concrete and realistic ways of improvement?

We can each commit to spending more time on each feature, maybe each team member can complete one feature

## How will its success be evaluated at the end of the iteration (Iteration 3) in a measurable and objective way?

We will keep track of how much time each of us spend on the different features in gitlab.

## Include a chart (as an image) showing the 2 data points of project velocity from the last two iterations
