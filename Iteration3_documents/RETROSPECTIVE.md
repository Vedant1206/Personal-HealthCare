# Retrospective Activity

We have not completed as many features as we would have liked. When we first started the project, we had many ideas for features that we were looking forward to implementing but due to time constraints and the amount of work involved we were not able to implement all of them. This can be improved this iteration by increasing the amount of time we spend working on features and implement as many as possible. We can each commit to spending more time on each feature, maybe each team member can commit to completing at least one user story. We will keep track of how much time each of us spend on the different features in GitLab. At the end of the iteration, we will look at how much time each of us spent working on features and how many features we were able to complete. If we each spend at least 3 days working on features, and we each complete at least one user story, it will be considered a success.
