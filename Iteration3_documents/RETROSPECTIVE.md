# Retrospective Activity

The first time we all met as a group, we discussed some ideas for our app and what kind of features it would have. Everybody came up with brilliant ideas and we were extremely excited about them. However, as we started working on our code, we faced more and more challenges. We had not realized how much code we would be writing and how much work would be involved, so we had many problems in the beginning. We have not completed as many features as we would have liked. When we first started the project, we had many ideas for features that we were looking forward to implementing but due to time constraints and because most of our group members are working part-time, we had less opportunities to get together and discuss our project.  Due to all these reasons, the amount of work involved became more than we expected and we were not able to implement all of them efficiently. This problem improved during this iteration because we increased the amount of time we spent working and communicating with our group members, so we spent more time working on features and implemented as many as possible. We divided the group and the work into smaller sub-groups for convenience and more efficient work. We can each commit to spending more time on each feature, maybe each team member can commit to completing at least one user story. We will keep track of how much time each of us spends on the different features in GitLab. At the end of the iteration, we will look at how much time each of us spent working on features and how many features we were able to complete. If we each spend at least 3 days working on features, and we each complete at least one user story, it will be considered a success.
